* Data should be stored in .csv format in folder `data/chip_<chip_id>/`
* Chip file: `print_<chip_id>.csv`
* Netlist file: `netlist_<netlist_id>.csv`
* See `data/chip_0/` for examples of input files
<br>

* Output is stored in folder `data/chip_<chip_id>/`
* Output consists of `output.csv` and `output_plot.png`
